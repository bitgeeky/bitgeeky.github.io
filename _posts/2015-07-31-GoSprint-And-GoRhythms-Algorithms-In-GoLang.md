Few weeks back I started a new section called `coding` on my blog. If you follow my blog you would have seen that there wasn't much activity and posts around that section as promised.
Its not that I have stoppped reading algorithms and just doing so called `cool` stuff, the reason for not making regular posts in that section is that most of the times when I read an algorithm, its implementation in C++ is given along with it. So writing the same code again isn't interesting, but I feel like implementing the algorithm and make a blog post whenever I read something new.

To deal with this problem, I am planning to do a `GoSprint`. In coming days whatever algorithm I read I'll post Go source code for its imlementation. This will allow me to implement the algorithm I read and also help me get a better grip on language.

I initiated a repository [GoRhythms](https://github.com/bitgeeky/GoRhythms) on GitHub which will contain all the code snippets, also I am renaming the `coding` section on my blog to `GoRhythms` since all the algorithms will now be posted under this section.

Shout out to all the Gophers out there, pull requests welcomed !
