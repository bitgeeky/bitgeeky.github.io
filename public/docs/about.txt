I'm a senior Computer Science student at <a href="http://iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIIT Hyderabad</a>. I have strong interest in Web Services and Distributed Systems and more than three years of experience with Python and Automation. I <3 Open Source, and try to <a href="http://github.com/bitgeeky" target="_blank">contribute</a> as much as I can. Sometimes I also <a href="/public/docs/MozillaAlumniCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">participate</a> in movements to keep the Web open.<br/><br/>I have worked as an Intern with mobile team at <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/" target="_blank">BrowserStack</a>. So probably, if you are using any of the mobile devices on BrowserStack then you are running some of my code. I got selected as a <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/bitgeeky/5741031244955648" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code Intern </a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/7bXgNb" target="_blank">worked</a> under the mentorship of some awesome devs at Mozilla Corporation. I took on some Infrastructure Orchestration tasks and DevOps stuff while <a href="http://pankajmalhotra.com/Infrastructure-Automation-Using-Terraform-Packer-Consul-Atlas/" target="_blank"> working as a Spring Scholar</a> with <a href="https://hashicorp.com/" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>.<br/><br/>Now that you are here, you might also like to explore other links.
