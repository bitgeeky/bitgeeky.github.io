Enjoying weather sitting outside airport
----
##### Friday 2015-09-20 #####
Sitting outside airport, having a cup of tea. It's still raining, weather is really good. I have started feeling a little bit cold now. I really like this kind of a place, seeing people passing by, some are coming, some are leaving and some sitting beside me filling their appetite, all kind of people from different age groups.

Looks like my idea of exploring the city is working out well. I just saw a banner titled Book Fair, and didn't take a moment to go inside.

Nice use of Web Audio API

These guys are playing live Djembe and filling the hall with music. They are using Web Audio API to capture sound signals and P5.js to visualze the music and beat being played. They are going to talk about the algorithm they are using to perfectly capture and process sound signals.
