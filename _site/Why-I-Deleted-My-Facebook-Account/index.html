  <h2>Why I Deleted My Facebook Account</h2>

  <p>Today I took a big decision to delete my Facebook account, went ahead and deleted it permanently. This wasn&#39;t a sudden decision, I have been planning to do this from a while and had a couple of experiments with my account before finally deleting it. I observed the statistics from the experiments really very carefully and took the decision in no hurry.</p>

<h2>Reasons to Delete the Account</h2>

<p>There were a couple of reasons which motivated me to go ahead and finally delete the account. A few of which I am mentioning below:</p>

<h2>1. Information Overflow</h2>

<p>I used Facebook mainly for messaging my friends and had joined a couple of groups to get important notifications but this is not the only thing you see on your news feed, its all the information about who likes what and who commented on what. Obviously one can argue that I could unfollow some of my friends, pages I liked or groups I joined.
I experimneted by managing my news feed but still there is irrelevent information that continously pops on your news feed which you wouldn&#39;t be interested in until you see it but once you see it you start getting interested in it.
For eg: I sometimes used to read the whole conversation on a post by just seeing that my friend commented on that post.
This was definitely not what I wanted.</p>

<h2>2. Feeling of being sold as a product</h2>

<p>I will never watch something I am not interested in. No, this is not the case with online media you tend to click the links that appear on your news feed. I was never interested in silly pranks, thug life videos, what color the dress is, cute animal videos, and whatever that goes viral on interenet without any reason. I find these things insignificant but you actually click on the links, watch these videos and partcipate in never ending discussions. There are guys who are making money out of this, and you actually don&#39;t realise what you are paying them. Its the most valuable thing your are paying to them , that is your <code>TIME</code>. Even if it was a tradeoff it would be tolerable, like you are getting entertained and you are paying your time but this gets to extent when you don&#39;t even want something but spend a considerable amount of time on these advertising contents. This gave me a feeling that I am the product being sold here.</p>

<h2>3. Couriosity and Addiction</h2>

<p>Being a software developer I spend a lot of time in front of computer and have small breaks in between, and the worst part is that I found myself just scrolling my news feed to see if someone has shared anything new. These breaks are usually distributed over the time I spend so I don&#39;t realise that how much time I spent using Facebook. This time could have been utilised in a number of ways but no, I wasted it on clicking some random links some of which I found useful and most of them I never would have clicked if I knew before what they contain. The experiment I did here was to disable my account for a few days and got surprised to find that I was actually addicted to such a behaviour. Whenver I took break I would try to open Facebook account and sometimes the urge was such that I couldn&#39;t resist it.
I definitely needed to do something about it.</p>

<h2>4. False Sense of Fame</h2>

<p>I am not a guy who would want his posts to get more number of likes, publicity or fame but bet me whatever type of a person you are you would defintely check how many people liked your post, who liked it and commented on it. Yes this happens, and sometimes to the extent that the first thing you would do after opening your account is to check the outreach of your recent post. The experiment I did here is that I used to unfollow the post or stop notifications but still in some cases I found myself checking back and I don&#39;t know why I was doing so. It gives a really false sense of fame and publicity.</p>

<p>So, these were the main reasons and wastage of time being the major one, I really wish to spend the time I get now productively. I can go out and relax in breaks I get, have a word with my friends, read more books and watch things I am actually interested in. Dear Facebook, I know my interests very well and don&#39;t want your advice.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Deleted my Facebook account.</p>

<p>Reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Information Overflow</li>
<li>Feeling of being sold as a product</li>
<li>Couriosity and Addiction</li>
<li>False Sense of Fame</li>
</ol>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I am not claiming that Facebook isn&#39;t good for you or advicing you to delete your accounts too. These are some of the things which I disliked about using Facebook and couldn&#39;t find a better solution.</p>

<h2>GoodBye Facebook !</h2>
