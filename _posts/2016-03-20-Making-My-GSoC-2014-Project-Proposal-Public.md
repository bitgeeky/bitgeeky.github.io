Many of my juniors are applying for Google Summer of Code this year, and I have been giving them few tips on how to write a good proposal. I decided to make my own proposal public so that anyone who wants to get some hints can go through it. I spent a lot of time writing this proposal and I am thankful to my project mentor and team manager for their helpful quality reviews.

Although this proposal is two years old since I applied in 2014, but most of the points will still be useful since there hasn't been much change in program since then.
