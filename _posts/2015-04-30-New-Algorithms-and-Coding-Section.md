Being heavily involved in Software Development and Automation from the last year, I didn't get much time to do competitive programming. I used to read algorithms and research papers in free time and implement some of them or solve some interesting problem. So to share these codes today I added a new section [coding](http://pankajmalhotra.com/coding) to my site.

What will it contain ?
----
This new section will contain a very brief explanation of Algorithm or the problem and the code for implementing it. Most of the problems will be from [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/) , [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/) , [CodeChef](http://www.codechef.com/) , [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/). I will add some brain teasers and logic puzzles too. Since I am planning to add them frequently, so they will not be verbose.

This section might also sometimes contain cool and fun scripts, So keep checking !
