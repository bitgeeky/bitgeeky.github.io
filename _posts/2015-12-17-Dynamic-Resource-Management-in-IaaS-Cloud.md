Few months back, I started working on a problem to dynamically manage resources in an Infrastructure as a Service platform, I wanted to build a model that would scale infrastrcuture based on application needs, and would help to reduce the cost and resource over utilization for the infrastructure provider and make the application robust by providing right amount of resources at the right time.

Due to academic workload and deadlines I had to shift my focus and adjust my priorities, thus moving away from the project. I am not entirely sure if and when I will be able to get back to this project, so I am making my research, explorations and experiments public in form of a summary/report, so that someone else working on the same problem would be able to make good use of my study and can continue from the point where I left.
