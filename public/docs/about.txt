<span id="a">about@pankajmalhotra</span>:<span id="b">~</span><span id="c">$</span> tail -f about.txt<br/>Hi, I'm Pankaj Malhotra.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> Most people know me by my IRC nick "bitgeeky". I work as a Software Development Manager with Amazon Web Services. I am primarily based in Cape Town, a very beautiful coastal city of South Africa. This is also the place where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gk_I_0eMDA" target="_blank"> EC2 and AWS started.</a> <br/><br/> My work primarily revolves around utilising AWS Managed services to develop serverless systems, which have service stacks available as cells based in multiple regions. Challenging part is to make the stacks operate individually and actively in multi-master mode for parallelising task executions and ensuring high availability of services.<br/><br/> Prior to joining AWS, I worked with the Infrastructure team at <a href="https://www.browserstack.com" target="_blank">BrowserStack</a> in Mumbai, India where I was involved in developing and operating cross region data center services to ensure high availability and uptime of BrowserStack products. So probably, if you are using any of the mobile devices on BrowserStack then you are running some of my code.<br/><br/>I have strong interest in Web Services and Distributed Systems and more than three years of experience with Python and Automation, also been writing a lot of Java code recently. I <3 Open Source, and try to <a href="https://github.com/bitgeeky" target="_blank">contribute</a> as much as I can. Sometimes I also <a href="/public/docs/MozillaAlumniCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">participate</a> in movements to keep the Web open. Also, got selected as a <a href="


" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code Intern </a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/7bXgNb" target="_blank">worked</a> under the mentorship of some awesome devs at Mozilla Corporation. I took on some Infrastructure Orchestration and DevOps tasks while <a href="https://pankajmalhotra.com/Infrastructure-Automation-Using-Terraform-Packer-Consul-Atlas" target="_blank"> working as a Spring Scholar</a> with <a href="https://hashicorp.com/" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>.<br/><br/>Now that you are here, you might also like to explore other links.
